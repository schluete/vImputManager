This is a typical "syslog.conf" problem: you must direct "syslog" information 
for the relevant "facility" and "level" to a destination. Unfortunately, the 
"facility" name that Apple gives for "launchd" in Tech Note TN2124 is wrong. 
Instead, I appended a "*.debug" line to my "syslog.conf" file and sent the 
output to /var/log/debug.log instead.
