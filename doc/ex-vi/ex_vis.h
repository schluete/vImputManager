 * HOLDAT prevents the clreol (clear to end of line) routines from
 * putting out @'s or ~'s on empty lines.
 *
 * HOLDDOL prevents the reopen routine from putting a '$' at the
 * end of a reopened line in list mode (for hardcopy mode, e.g.).
 *
 * HOLDROL prevents spurious blank lines when scrolling in hardcopy
 * open mode.
 *
 * HOLDQIK prevents the fake insert mode during repeated commands.
 *
 * HOLDPUPD prevents updating of the physical screen image when
 * mucking around while in insert mode.
 *
 * HOLDECH prevents clearing of the echo area while rolling the screen
 * backwards (e.g.) in deference to the clearing of the area at the
 * end of the scroll (1 time instead of n times).  The fact that this
 * is actually needed is recorded in heldech, which says that a clear
 * of the echo area was actually held off.
