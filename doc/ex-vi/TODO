TODO list for ex

- Some support for UTF-8 combining characters should probably be added.

- Since the POSIX standard developers did not include a method to
    determine whether something is a valid collation symbol or an
    equivalence class, and since there is no access to the basic
    collation sequence, LC_COLLATE locales are completely ignored.

- SVr4 ex probably has some silent features that this one should have too.
